# Acknowledgements

The book idea started as a note in April 2020. I asked Kholoud, my wife, what do you think about writing a book about debugging CSS? I told her that it will be a very short one (60 pages max). Seven months later, the book has 300 pages. Kholoud was the first person to support the book idea, and she insisted that I should move on with this, and here we are. Thank you, my dearest person!



The first person that encouraged me from the community is Mr. John Allsopp. He invited me to talk at Web Directions conference about the book topic and was one of the first supporters. Thank you very much!



I want to thank is Geoffrey Crofte. He was helpful and kind enough to proofread the whole book, and highlighting a lot of fixes. Thank you very much!



Finally, I would like to thank Bram Van Damme, who reviewed the very first draft of the book. He highlighted some important things that I should improve. Thank you, Bram!
